        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>When my grandfather, James Hathaway, opened The 3 Flavors Shop on August 20th, 1941 he never imagined the ice cream parlor would become such a landmark in our fair city.</p>
        <p>Originally named The 3 Flavors Shop because he only had 3 flavors of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, and mint chocolate chip.</p>
        <p>James could be found every day at the shop ready to serve you up a root beer float or a sundae.</p>
        <p>In 1984, my grandfather passed along the shop to my father, Mark. My father, continued his father&#146s traditions of great service and wonderful ice cream.</p>
        <p>In 2010, my father passed along the shop to me. I hope to continue their legacies of providing the best ice cream in town, the highest levels of service, and a fun place to hang out.</p>
        <p>Things have changed a lot over the past 75 years and we offer a lot more than 3 flavors now. But we still produce every flavor in the back of our shop.</p>
        <p>So whether you need a place to take your first date after a great dinner at Tony's or you just need a cool treat on a hot day, come on down to the shop.</p>
        <p>We&#146re still at the same location as when my grandfather opened the doors all those years ago, <a href="https://maps.google.com">108 East Main Street</a>. See you soon!</p>
