<h2>Our Story</h2>

<p>Before opening <span>Ketchup With Ya Later</span> John, James, and Chris were just a couple of college buddies that all had finance jobs. After trying that for awhile, they found it just wasn&#39;t for them. They all wanted to do something different, to ditch the tie and slacks for a t-shirt and shorts. So, they decided they&#39;d try their hand at something they all loved, food. Ketchup With Ya Later was born.</p>

<p>The guys wanted to provide the highest quality burgers, so they&nbsp;made a&nbsp;pledge to always use beef that is&nbsp;never frozen and&nbsp;always fresh,&nbsp;local, and&nbsp;hormone-free. They&nbsp;never want you to have to compromise between&nbsp;quality and&nbsp;taste. They believe their&nbsp;menu reflects that.</p>

<p>In 2010, the guys opened <span>Ketchup With Ya Later</span> in a small downtown space, 201 W 3rd Ave. After 3 successful years, it was time to move to a larger location. Eventually the guys settled on a place a few blocks away, <a href="https://maps.google.com">132 E. Main St</a>.</p>

<p><span>Ketchup With Ya Later</span> is all about good times, quality ingredients, and great food. Luckily, you all seem to agree and it seems that the way <span>Ketchup With Ya Later</span>&nbsp;makes the burgers&nbsp;is just the way you like them. How do we know? <span>Ketchup With Ya Later</span> has&nbsp;won <span>Best Burger In The City 5 out of the last 6 years</span>!</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe that our burger was worth you spending your time and hard earned money in our restaurant, we will do everything we can to make that right.</p>

<p>So&nbsp;come on in, give us a try. I can promise nobody serves up grilled patties and dogs like we do.</p>
